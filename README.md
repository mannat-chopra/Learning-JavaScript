# Learning-JavaScript
Hey there, I am learning JavaScript. Everyday new concept that you can also follow to learn javascript. 
1. JavaScript Basics

Javascript is a High Level, Light-weighted, Interpreted JIT compiled Multi-Paradigm
Prototype Based Synchronous, Single Threaded Dynamic Language.
To understand the above definition, you should know what each term signifies within
this context.
Here is a definition of each term used above:
● High Level
○ High-level languages are those languages that are independent of
system architecture.
● Light-weighted
○ The lightweight application is a computer program designed to have
low system resource usage.
● Interpreted or JIT-compiled
○ An interpreter in the browser reads over the JavaScript to JS code,
interprets each line, and runs it. More modern browsers use a JIT
compilation which compiles JS to executable bytecode just as it is
about to run.
● Multi-Paradigm
○ It supports different styles of writing the same code.
● Prototype Based
○ This type of style allows the creation of an object without first defining
its class.
● Synchronous
○ Synchronous means the code runs in a particular sequence of
instructions as given in the program.
● Single-Threaded
○ Single-threaded means it executes one line of code at a time. So it
executes the current line of code before going to the next line.
● Dynamic Language
○ Dynamic refers to the value which is capable of change at run time.
